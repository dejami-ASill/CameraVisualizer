# CameraVisualizer


This is just a project to show the camera preview through an OpenGL ES texture. This project demonstates how threading and interprocess communication (IPC) can work. This also demonstrates a few simple fragment shaders to the live camera preview surface texture by swiping the screen left or right. 


The selected shape (Triangle, Rectangle, more coming) will now be drawn over the camera preview surface and change colors based on the music/sound input from the device microphone. I plan to add more complex shapes and better adjust colors based on sound input.
