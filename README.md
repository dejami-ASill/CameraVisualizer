# CameraVisualizer


This is just a simple project to show the camera preview through an OpenGL ES texture. This project demonstates how threading and interprocess communication (IPC) can work. This also demonstrates a few simple fragment shaders to the live camera preview surface texture by swiping. Further work is coming demonstrating how to record audio and using OpenL to create a simple visualizer for detected sounds/music.
